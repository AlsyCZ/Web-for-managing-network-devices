# Web-for-managing-network-devices

Goal is to create a web application for managing network devices using MikroTik routers and configuring them. The application will offer a clear and intuitive interface for users to remotely monitor and control network elements, backend developed in Node.js and the frontend in React.


## Build with
- Mikrotik RouterOS API
 - Visual Studio Code
 - Node JS
 - React
 - Localhost
 - Bootstrap

## Requirements

- You need to install React library and Node JS framework.
- Also you need to CREATE .env file in your root directory, and give API connection to your router!
(I dont want to give you access to my whole home network. :D)

For example:
- API_HOST= 345678ba32x0d.sn.mynetname.net
- API_USER= admin
- API_PASSWORD= 12345678
- API_PORT= 8757
